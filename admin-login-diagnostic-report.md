# Admin Login Diagnostic Report

## Executive Summary
The admin login functionality has a critical issue where the "Sign In" button remains disabled even when valid credentials are entered. This prevents administrators from accessing the admin panel.

## Issues Identified

### 1. React State Not Updating Properly ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** When entering credentials (either manually or via "Fill Test Credentials"), the React state variables (`email` and `password`) are not being properly updated, causing the Sign In button to remain disabled.

**Evidence:**
- Button disabled condition: `disabled={loading || !email || !password}` (line 115 in `/app/admin/login/page.tsx`)
- Even with values visible in input fields, the state remains empty
- No login API request is triggered when attempting to sign in

### 2. Multiple Static Resource 400 Errors
**Problem:** Several static resources fail to load with 400 Bad Request errors:
- CSS files: `_next/static/css/5cc081976e0275ee.css`
- Font files: Multiple `.woff2` files
- JavaScript chunks: webpack, main-app, and page-specific chunks

**Impact:** While not directly preventing login, these errors may indicate a broader Next.js build or serving issue.

### 3. Input Event Handling Issue
**Problem:** The onChange handlers for the input fields are not being triggered properly:
```jsx
onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}  // Line 71
onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} // Line 94
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be with how the React components handle input events. Possible causes:

1. **Next.js Hydration Mismatch**: The client-side JavaScript may not be properly hydrating due to the 400 errors on static assets
2. **Event Handler Binding**: The onChange events may not be properly bound to the input elements
3. **Build/Compilation Issue**: The numerous 400 errors suggest the application may not be built correctly

## Verification Steps Completed

‚úÖ Database connection verified - working correctly
‚úÖ Admin user exists in database: `admin@backroomleeds.co.uk`
‚úÖ Login page UI renders correctly
‚úÖ Input fields accept text visually
‚ùå React state does not update when typing
‚ùå Sign In button remains disabled
‚ùå No API request sent to `/api/admin/auth/login`

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix (Priority 1)
1. **Rebuild the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear Next.js cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

### Code Fix (Priority 2)
3. **Update the login component to use uncontrolled inputs with useRef**:
   ```tsx
   // Alternative approach using refs instead of state
   const emailRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
   const passwordRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

   const handleLogin = async () => {
     const email = emailRef.current?.value || '';
     const password = passwordRef.current?.value || '';
     // ... rest of login logic
   };
   ```

4. **Add form submission as backup**:
   ```tsx
   <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
     {/* inputs */}
     <button type="submit">Sign In</button>
   </form>
   ```

### Investigation (Priority 3)
5. **Check Next.js version compatibility**:
   - Verify all dependencies are compatible with Next.js 15.5.2
   - Check for any known issues with React 19 RC

6. **Verify environment variables**:
   - Ensure all required env vars are set
   - Check NODE_ENV setting

## Testing Checklist

After implementing fixes, verify:
- [ ] Static assets load without 400 errors
- [ ] Input fields trigger onChange events
- [ ] React DevTools show state updates
- [ ] Sign In button enables with valid input
- [ ] Login API request is sent
- [ ] Successful login redirects to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] JWT cookie is set correctly
- [ ] Protected routes are accessible post-login

## Temporary Workaround

Until the issue is resolved, administrators can:
1. Use the test login page at `/test-login` (if available)
2. Manually set the JWT cookie via browser DevTools
3. Access the admin panel directly if already authenticated

## Conclusion

The admin login is currently non-functional due to React state management issues, likely caused by JavaScript hydration problems stemming from the static resource loading failures. The recommended immediate action is to rebuild the application and clear caches. If the issue persists, implementing the code fixes should resolve the problem.

**Status:** üî¥ Critical - Admin access blocked
**Priority:** P0 - Immediate action required
**Estimated Fix Time:** 15-30 minutes
