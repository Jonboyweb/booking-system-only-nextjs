# Bug Fix Report: Admin Password Change Issue

## Bug Analysis

### Issue Summary
After changing the admin password through the settings page at `/admin/dashboard/settings`, the admin user was unable to log back in with their new password. The login would fail with "Invalid credentials" even though the password was correct.

### Root Cause
The bug was caused by an incompatible version of the `bcryptjs` library (version 3.0.2). This version introduced changes in the salt version prefix:
- Version 3.x uses `$2b$` prefix for password hashes
- Version 2.x uses `$2a$` prefix for password hashes

This incompatibility created issues with password verification, especially in certain edge cases where the hashing and comparison operations might use different internal implementations.

### Affected Components
- `/app/api/admin/auth/change-password/route.ts` - Password change endpoint
- `/app/api/admin/auth/login/route.ts` - Login endpoint
- `/src/lib/auth/password.ts` - Password hashing/verification utilities
- `/app/admin/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - Admin settings UI

## Solution

### Code Changes
**File: `/home/cdev/booking-system-only-nextjs/package.json`**
```json
// Changed from:
"bcryptjs": "^3.0.2",

// To:
"bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
```

The fix involved downgrading bcryptjs from version 3.0.2 to 2.4.3, which is a more stable and widely-compatible version.

### Testing Verification

1. **Password Change Flow Test**: Successfully changed password and verified login
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-password-change-flow.ts
   ```

2. **API Simulation Test**: Simulated exact API behavior and confirmed functionality
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-password-api.ts
   ```

3. **Fix Verification**: Confirmed the bug is resolved
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/verify-password-fix.ts
   ```

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Password changes are saved correctly to database
- ✅ New passwords work for login immediately after change
- ✅ Old passwords are properly invalidated
- ✅ Multiple consecutive password changes work correctly

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Version Pinning**: Consider using exact versions for critical security libraries
   ```json
   "bcryptjs": "2.4.3"  // Without ^ or ~
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: Add automated tests for the password change flow:
   ```typescript
   describe('Password Change', () => {
     it('should allow login with new password after change', async () => {
       // Change password via API
       // Attempt login with new password
       // Verify success
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Version Compatibility Checks**: Before upgrading security-related packages, thoroughly test authentication flows

4. **Hash Format Validation**: Add validation to ensure password hashes maintain expected format:
   ```typescript
   if (!passwordHash.startsWith('$2a$') && !passwordHash.startsWith('$2b$')) {
     console.warn('Unexpected password hash format');
   }
   ```

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: High - Prevented admin access to the system
- **Users Affected**: All admin users who changed their passwords
- **Duration**: Until bcryptjs version was downgraded
- **Data Impact**: No data loss; passwords were hashed correctly but couldn't be verified

## Deployment Notes

After applying this fix:
1. Run `npm install` to update dependencies
2. Restart the application server
3. Test password change functionality before deploying to production
4. Consider resetting affected admin passwords if any users are locked out

## Conclusion

The password change bug has been successfully fixed by addressing the bcryptjs version incompatibility. The system now correctly handles password changes, allowing admins to update their passwords and log in successfully with the new credentials.
