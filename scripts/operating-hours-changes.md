# Operating Hours and Booking Time Slots - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Operating Hours Configuration
**File**: `/lib/operating-hours.ts`

#### Regular Hours
- **Venue Operating Hours**: 23:00 - 06:00 (11pm - 6am)
- **Last Booking Time**: 02:00 (2am)
- **Booking Window**: 23:00 - 02:00 (customers can arrive between 11pm and 2am)

#### Special Events
- **New Year's Eve (Dec 31)**
  - Venue: 21:00 - 06:00
  - Bookings until: 03:00
  - Extended early and late booking slots

- **Christmas Eve (Dec 24)**
  - Venue: 22:00 - 06:00
  - Bookings until: 02:00
  - Earlier start but standard cutoff

- **Christmas Day (Dec 25)**
  - Venue: 22:00 - 06:00
  - Bookings until: 03:00
  - Earlier start with extended cutoff

### 2. Fixed Time Slot Generation
The `generateTimeSlots()` function now uses `lastBookingTime` instead of `endTime` to generate booking slots. This ensures customers can only book arrival times within the allowed window, even though the venue stays open later.

### 3. Updated Validation Functions
- `isTimeWithinOperatingHours()`: Now validates against `lastBookingTime` for booking validation
- `isValidBookingTimeSlot()`: Continues to check if a time is in the valid booking slots

### 4. Frontend Display Updates
**File**: `/components/booking/DateTimeSelector.tsx`

Updated to clearly show:
- Regular days: "Venue open: 23:00 - 06:00 | Last arrival: 02:00"
- Special events: Shows both venue hours and booking cutoff times

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created
1. `/scripts/test-operating-hours.ts` - Tests time slot generation and validation
2. `/scripts/test-booking-with-new-hours.ts` - Tests booking validation with database

### Test Results
✅ Regular days generate correct slots: 23:00, 23:30, 00:00, 00:30, 01:00, 01:30, 02:00
✅ New Year's Eve generates extended slots: 21:00 to 03:00 (13 slots total)
✅ Christmas Eve has early start (22:00) with standard cutoff (02:00)
✅ Christmas Day has early start (22:00) with extended cutoff (03:00)
✅ Validation correctly rejects times outside booking window
✅ API returns correct operating hours and time slots

## API Response Example

### Regular Day (Feb 15, 2025)
```json
{
  "operatingHours": {
    "startTime": "23:00",
    "endTime": "06:00",
    "lastBookingTime": "02:00",
    "isSpecialEvent": false
  },
  "timeSlots": ["23:00", "23:30", "00:00", "00:30", "01:00", "01:30", "02:00"]
}
```

### New Year's Eve (Dec 31, 2025)
```json
{
  "operatingHours": {
    "startTime": "21:00",
    "endTime": "06:00",
    "lastBookingTime": "03:00",
    "isSpecialEvent": true,
    "eventName": "New Year's Eve"
  },
  "timeSlots": ["21:00", "21:30", "22:00", "22:30", "23:00", "23:30",
                "00:00", "00:30", "01:00", "01:30", "02:00", "02:30", "03:00"]
}
```

## Key Points
1. The venue's actual operating hours (until 6am) are now correctly stored
2. Booking slots are properly restricted to the booking window (until 2am regular, 3am special)
3. The distinction between operating hours and booking window is clear in the UI
4. All validation functions work correctly with the new hours
5. Special events can have both earlier start times and extended booking windows
